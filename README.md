# Accumbens-Rew-learning

Code for the analysis of behavioral and electrophysiological files collected for my thesis work (2014-2019). 

Recordings were taken from the NAc core of rats as they were trained in a cued approach task. 

Folders:
- "All data extract" are the code files that provide the structure for the data analysis of each experiment. 
- "R functions" are functions that are called from the "All data extract" scripts. 
- "Change point master" contains functions that apply to the calculation of a behavioral Change Point.
